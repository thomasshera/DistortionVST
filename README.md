# DistortionVST

The current goal of this project is to create a distortion VST.

The interface is built using stock JUCE, but I think it looks good.

The primary inspiration is D16 Group's Devastor 2, a distortion VST offering multiple filters, six distortion types, a pre-distortion compressor, a limiter, and a very musical preamp.
